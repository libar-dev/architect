| packages/my-package/ | delivery-process.config.ts | generic | Simpler taxonomy for individual package |
| packages/simple/ | (none) | libar-generic (fallback) | Uses root or default |

---

## DD-1 - Text output with section markers per ADR-008

---

## DD-2 - Git integration is opt-in via --git flag

---

## DD-3 - Session type inferred from FSM status

---

## DD-4 - Severity levels match Process Guard model

---

## DD-5 - Current date only for handoff

---

## DD-6 - Both positional and flag forms for scope type

---

## DD-7 - Co-located formatter functions

---

## Session Decision Tree

| Session | Input | Output | FSM Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Planning | Pattern brief | Roadmap spec (.feature) | Creates roadmap |
| Design | Complex requirement | Decision specs + code stubs | None |
| Implementation | Roadmap spec | Code + tests | roadmap to active to completed |
| Planning + Design | Pattern brief | Spec + stubs | Creates roadmap |

---

## Planning Session

| Forbidden Action | Rationale |
| --- | --- |
| Create .ts implementation files | Planning only creates specs |
| Transition to active | Active requires implementation readiness |
| Ask Ready to implement? | Planning session ends at roadmap spec |
| Write full implementations | Stubs only if Planning + Design |

---

## Design Session

| Use Design Session | Skip Design Session |
| --- | --- |
| Multiple valid approaches | Single obvious path |
| New patterns/capabilities | Bug fix |
| Cross-context coordination | Clear requirements |

| Forbidden Action | Rationale |
| --- | --- |
| Create markdown design documents | Decision specs provide better traceability with structured tags |
| Create implementation plans | Design focuses on architecture |
| Transition spec to active | Requires implementation session |
| Write full implementations | Stubs only |

---

## Implementation Session

| Requirement | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Roadmap spec exists with at-prefix-status:roadmap | Cannot implement without spec |
| Decision specs approved (if needed) | Complex decisions need approval |
| Implementation plan exists (for multi-session work) | Prevents scope drift |

| Forbidden Action | Rationale |
| --- | --- |
| Add new deliverables to active spec | Scope-locked state prevents this |
| Mark completed with incomplete work | Hard-locked state cannot be undone |
| Skip FSM transitions | Process Guard will reject |
| Edit generated docs directly | Regenerate from source |

---

## Planning + Design Session

| Use Planning + Design | Use Planning Only |
| --- | --- |
| Need stubs for implementation | Only enhancing spec |
| Preparing for immediate handoff | Still exploring requirements |
| Want complete two-tier architecture | Do not need Tier 2 yet |

---

## FSM Protection

| State | Protection | Can Add Deliverables | Needs Unlock | Allowed Actions | Blocked Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| roadmap | None | Yes | No | Full editing, add deliverables | None |
| deferred | None | Yes | No | Full editing, add deliverables | None |
| active | Scope-locked | No | No | Edit existing deliverables | Adding new deliverables |
| completed | Hard-locked | No | Yes | Nothing | Any change without unlock tag |

| From | To | Trigger | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| roadmap | active | Start work | Locks scope |
| roadmap | deferred | Postpone | For deprioritized work |
| active | completed | Finish | Terminal state |
| active | roadmap | Regress | For blocked work |
| deferred | roadmap | Resume | To restart planning |

| Attempted | Why Invalid | Valid Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| roadmap to completed | Must go through active | roadmap to active to completed |
| deferred to active | Must return to roadmap first | deferred to roadmap to active |
| deferred to completed | Cannot skip two states | deferred to roadmap to active to completed |
| completed to any | Terminal state | Use unlock-reason tag to modify |

---

## FSM Error Messages and Fixes

| Error | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| completed-protection | File has completed status but no unlock tag | Add unlock-reason tag with hyphenated reason |
| invalid-status-transition | Skipped FSM state (e.g., roadmap to completed) | Follow path: roadmap to active to completed |
| scope-creep | Added deliverable to active spec | Remove deliverable OR revert to roadmap |
| session-scope (warning) | Modified file outside session scope | Add to scope OR use --ignore-session |
| session-excluded | Modified excluded pattern during session | Remove from exclusion OR override |
| deliverable-removed (warning) | Deliverable was removed from spec | Informational only, verify intentional |

---

## Escape Hatches

| Situation | Solution | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fix bug in completed spec | Add unlock-reason tag | at-prefix-unlock-reason:'Fix-typo' |
| Modify outside session scope | Use --ignore-session flag | lint-process --staged --ignore-session |
| CI treats warnings as errors | Use --strict flag | lint-process --all --strict |
| Emergency hotfix | Combine unlock + ignore | at-prefix-unlock-reason:'Hotfix' plus --ignore-session |

---

## Handoff Documentation

| Element | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Last completed | What finished this session |
| In progress | What is partially done |
| Blockers | What prevents progress |
| Files Modified | Track changes for review |
| Next Session | Clear starting point |

---

## Discovery Tags

| Tag | Purpose | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| at-prefix-discovered-gap | Missing edge case or feature | Missing-validation-for-empty-input |
| at-prefix-discovered-improvement | Performance or DX enhancement | Cache-parsed-results |
| at-prefix-discovered-learning | Knowledge gained | Gherkin-requires-strict-indentation |

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Is Wrong | Correct Approach |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Creating .ts implementation files | Planning only creates specs | Create spec file only, no code |
| Transitioning to active | Active requires implementation readiness | Keep status as roadmap |
| Asking Ready to implement? | Planning session ends at roadmap spec | End session after spec complete |
| Writing full implementations | Stubs only if Planning + Design | Save implementation for Implementation session |

| Mistake | Why It Is Wrong | Correct Approach |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Writing code before transition | FSM must be active first | Change status to active FIRST |
| Adding deliverables to active spec | Scope-locked state prevents this | Revert to roadmap to add scope |
| Marking completed with incomplete work | Hard-locked state cannot be undone | Finish ALL deliverables first |
| Skipping FSM transitions | Process Guard will reject | Follow roadmap to active to completed |
| Editing generated docs directly | Will be overwritten | Regenerate from source |

| Mistake | Why It Is Wrong | Correct Approach |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Creating markdown design documents | Decision specs provide better traceability | Record decisions as PDR .feature files in delivery-process/decisions/ |
| Creating implementation plans | Design focuses on architecture | Document options and decisions only |
| Transitioning spec to active | Requires implementation session | Keep status as roadmap |
| Writing full implementations | Design creates stubs only | Use throw new Error pattern |
