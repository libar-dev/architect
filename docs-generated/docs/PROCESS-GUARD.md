# ProcessGuard

**Purpose:** Full documentation generated from decision document
**Detail Level:** detailed

---

**Context:**
  The delivery workflow needs protection against accidental modifications:
  - Completed specs get modified without explicit unlock reason
  - Status transitions bypass FSM rules (e.g., roadmap -> completed)
  - Active specs expand scope unexpectedly with new deliverables
  - Changes occur outside session boundaries without warning

  Without validation, the delivery process relies on human discipline alone.
  Mistakes ripple through documentation generation and workflow tracking.

  **Decision:**
  Implement a Decider-based linter that validates git changes at commit time:
  - **Pure functions:** No I/O in validation logic, easy to test
  - **Derived state:** State computed from file annotations, not stored separately
  - **Protection levels:** Files inherit protection from `@libar-docs-status` tag
  - **FSM enforcement:** Transitions validated against PDR-005 state machine
  - **Session scoping:** Warnings for out-of-scope files, errors for excluded files
  - **Escape hatch:** `@libar-docs-unlock-reason` allows modifying completed specs

  **Consequences:**
  - (+) Invalid workflow transitions caught before commit
  - (+) Scope creep prevented on active specs
  - (+) Completed work protected from accidental modification
  - (+) Session boundaries enforce focus
  - (-) Learning curve for unlock-reason workflow
  - (-) Requires pre-commit hook setup

## Context

### Why Process Guard Exists

The delivery workflow defines states for specifications:
    - **roadmap:** Planning phase, fully editable
    - **active:** Implementation in progress, scope-locked
    - **completed:** Work finished, hard-locked
    - **deferred:** Parked work, fully editable

    Without enforcement, these states are advisory only. Process Guard
    makes them enforceable through pre-commit validation.

## Decision

### How Process Guard Works

Process Guard implements 7 validation rules:

    | Rule ID | Severity | What It Checks |
    | completed-protection | error | Completed specs require unlock reason |
    | invalid-status-transition | error | Transitions must follow FSM |
    | scope-creep | error | Active specs cannot add deliverables |
    | session-excluded | error | Cannot modify excluded files |
    | missing-relationship-target | warning | Relationship target must exist |
    | session-scope | warning | File outside session scope |
    | deliverable-removed | warning | Deliverable was removed |

    The linter runs as a pre-commit hook via Husky.
    See `.husky/pre-commit` for the hook configuration.

    Pre-commit: `npx lint-process --staged`
    CI pipeline: `npx lint-process --all --strict`

## Implementation Details

### Context

The delivery workflow defines states for specifications:
    - **roadmap:** Planning phase, fully editable
    - **active:** Implementation in progress, scope-locked
    - **completed:** Work finished, hard-locked
    - **deferred:** Parked work, fully editable

    Without enforcement, these states are advisory only. Process Guard
    makes them enforceable through pre-commit validation.

### How It Works

Process Guard implements 7 validation rules:

    | Rule ID | Severity | What It Checks |
    | completed-protection | error | Completed specs require unlock reason |
    | invalid-status-transition | error | Transitions must follow FSM |
    | scope-creep | error | Active specs cannot add deliverables |
    | session-excluded | error | Cannot modify excluded files |
    | missing-relationship-target | warning | Relationship target must exist |
    | session-scope | warning | File outside session scope |
    | deliverable-removed | warning | Deliverable was removed |

    The linter runs as a pre-commit hook via Husky.
    See `.husky/pre-commit` for the hook configuration.

    Pre-commit: `npx lint-process --staged`
    CI pipeline: `npx lint-process --all --strict`

### Trade-offs

**Benefits:**
    - Catches workflow errors before they enter git history
    - Prevents accidental scope creep during active development
    - Protects completed work from unintended modifications
    - Clear escape hatch via unlock-reason annotation

    **Costs:**
    - Requires understanding of FSM states and transitions
    - Initial friction when modifying completed specs
    - Pre-commit hook adds a few seconds to commit time

### Validation Rules

### Completed files require unlock-reason to modify

### Status transitions must follow PDR-005 FSM

### Active specs cannot add new deliverables

### Files outside active session scope trigger warnings

### Explicitly excluded files trigger errors

### Multiple rules validate independently

### Protection Levels

| status | protection | restriction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| roadmap | none | Fully editable |
| deferred | none | Fully editable |
| active | scope | Errors on new deliverables |
| completed | hard | Requires @libar-docs-unlock-reason |

### Valid Transitions

| from | to |
| --- | --- |
| roadmap | active |
| roadmap | deferred |
| active | completed |
| active | roadmap |
| deferred | roadmap |
| roadmap | roadmap |

| from | to |
| --- | --- |
| roadmap | completed |
| deferred | active |
| deferred | completed |
| completed | active |
| completed | roadmap |
| completed | deferred |

### API Types

```typescript
/**

### Decider API

```typescript
/**
 * Validate changes against process rules.
 *
 * Pure function following the Decider pattern:
 * - Takes all inputs explicitly (no hidden state)
 * - Returns result without side effects
 * - Emits events for observability
 *
 * @param input - Complete input including state, changes, and options
 * @returns DeciderOutput with validation result and events
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const output = validateChanges({
 *   state: processState,
 *   changes: changeDetection,
 *   options: { strict: false, ignoreSession: false },
 * });
 *
 * if (!output.result.valid) {
 *   console.log('Violations:', output.result.violations);
 * }
 * ```
 */
function validateChanges(input: DeciderInput): DeciderOutput;
```

### CLI Options

Validates git changes against delivery process rules.

### Error Messages

| Error Code |
|---|
| completed-protection |
| invalid-status-transition |
| scope-creep |
| deliverable-removed |
| session-scope |
| session-excluded |

## Consequences

### Trade-offs of This Approach

**Benefits:**
    - Catches workflow errors before they enter git history
    - Prevents accidental scope creep during active development
    - Protects completed work from unintended modifications
    - Clear escape hatch via unlock-reason annotation

    **Costs:**
    - Requires understanding of FSM states and transitions
    - Initial friction when modifying completed specs
    - Pre-commit hook adds a few seconds to commit time

## FSM Diagram

The FSM enforces valid state transitions. Protection levels and transitions
    are defined in TypeScript (extracted via @extract-shapes).

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
        [*] --> roadmap
        roadmap --> active : Start work
        roadmap --> deferred : Postpone
        active --> completed : Finish
        active --> roadmap : Regress (blocked)
        deferred --> roadmap : Resume
        completed --> [*]

        note right of completed : Terminal state
        note right of active : Scope-locked
```

## Escape Hatches

**Context:** Sometimes process rules need to be bypassed for legitimate reasons.

    **Decision:** These escape hatches are available:

| Situation | Solution | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fix bug in completed spec | Add unlock-reason tag | @libar-docs-unlock-reason:'Fix-typo' |
| Modify outside session scope | Use --ignore-session flag | lint-process --staged --ignore-session |
| CI warnings blocking pipeline | Omit --strict flag | lint-process --all (warnings won't fail) |

## Rule Descriptions

Process Guard validates 7 rules (types extracted from TypeScript):

| Rule | Severity | Human Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| completed-protection | error | Cannot modify completed specs without unlock-reason |
| invalid-status-transition | error | Status transition must follow FSM |
| scope-creep | error | Cannot add deliverables to active specs |
| session-excluded | error | Cannot modify files excluded from session |
| missing-relationship-target | warning | Relationship target must exist |
| session-scope | warning | File not in active session scope |
| deliverable-removed | warning | Deliverable was removed (informational) |

## CLI Usage

Process Guard is invoked via the lint-process CLI command.
    Configuration interface (`ProcessGuardCLIConfig`) is extracted from `src/cli/lint-process.ts`.

    **CLI Commands:**

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `lint-process --staged` | Pre-commit validation (default mode) |
| `lint-process --all --strict` | CI pipeline with strict mode |
| `lint-process --file specs/my-feature.feature` | Validate specific file |
| `lint-process --staged --show-state` | Debug: show derived process state |
| `lint-process --staged --ignore-session` | Override session scope checking |

    **CLI Options:**

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--staged` | Validate staged files only (pre-commit) |
| `--all` | Validate all tracked files (CI) |
| `--strict` | Treat warnings as errors (exit 1) |
| `--ignore-session` | Skip session scope validation |
| `--show-state` | Debug: show derived process state |
| `--format json` | Machine-readable JSON output |
| `--file <path>` | Validate a specific file |

    **Integration:** See `.husky/pre-commit` for pre-commit hook setup and `package.json` scripts section for npm script configuration.

## Programmatic API

Process Guard can be used programmatically for custom integrations.

    **Usage Example:**

```typescript
import {
      deriveProcessState,
      detectStagedChanges,
      validateChanges,
      hasErrors,
      summarizeResult,
    } from '@libar-dev/delivery-process/lint';

    const state = (await deriveProcessState({ baseDir: '.' })).value;
    const changes = detectStagedChanges('.').value;
    const { result } = validateChanges({
      state,
      changes,
      options: { strict: false, ignoreSession: false },
    });

    if (hasErrors(result)) {
      console.log(summarizeResult(result));
      for (const v of result.violations) {
        console.log(`[${v.rule}] ${v.file}: ${v.message}`);
      }
      process.exit(1);
    }
```

**API Functions:**

| Category | Function | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| State | deriveProcessState(cfg) | Build state from file annotations |
| Changes | detectStagedChanges(dir) | Parse staged git diff |
| Changes | detectBranchChanges(dir) | Parse all changes vs main |
| Changes | detectFileChanges(dir, f) | Parse specific files |
| Validate | validateChanges(input) | Run all validation rules |
| Results | hasErrors(result) | Check for blocking errors |
| Results | hasWarnings(result) | Check for warnings |
| Results | summarizeResult(result) | Human-readable summary |

## Architecture

Process Guard uses the Decider pattern for testable validation.

    **Data Flow Diagram:**

```mermaid
flowchart LR
        A[deriveProcessState] --> C[validateChanges]
        B[detectChanges] --> C
        C --> D[ValidationResult]

        subgraph Pure Functions
            C
        end

        subgraph I/O
            A
            B
        end
```

**Principle:** State is derived from file annotations - there is no separate state file to maintain.
