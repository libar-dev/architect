# ✅ ADR-006: Process Guard

**Purpose:** Architecture decision record for Process Guard

---

## Overview

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Status | accepted |
| Category | process |
| Phase | 99 |

## Context

The delivery workflow defines states for specifications:
    - **roadmap:** Planning phase, fully editable
    - **active:** Implementation in progress, scope-locked
    - **completed:** Work finished, hard-locked
    - **deferred:** Parked work, fully editable

    Without enforcement, these states are advisory only. Process Guard
    makes them enforceable through pre-commit validation.

## Decision

Process Guard implements 7 validation rules:

    | Rule ID | Severity | What It Checks |
    | completed-protection | error | Completed specs require unlock reason |
    | invalid-status-transition | error | Transitions must follow FSM |
    | scope-creep | error | Active specs cannot add deliverables |
    | session-excluded | error | Cannot modify excluded files |
    | missing-relationship-target | warning | Relationship target must exist |
    | session-scope | warning | File outside session scope |
    | deliverable-removed | warning | Deliverable was removed |

    The linter runs as a pre-commit hook via Husky.
    See `.husky/pre-commit` for the hook configuration.

    Pre-commit: `npx lint-process --staged`
    CI pipeline: `npx lint-process --all --strict`

## Consequences

**Benefits:**
    - Catches workflow errors before they enter git history
    - Prevents accidental scope creep during active development
    - Protects completed work from unintended modifications
    - Clear escape hatch via unlock-reason annotation

    **Costs:**
    - Requires understanding of FSM states and transitions
    - Initial friction when modifying completed specs
    - Pre-commit hook adds a few seconds to commit time
